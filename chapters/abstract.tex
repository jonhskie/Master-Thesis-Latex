Verifying software algorithms alongside physical behavior of autonomous robots remains a complex challenge in modern robotics. Simulations often lack physical fidelity, and constructing physical test environments is frequently slow and resource-intensive. This thesis presents a Mixed Reality Environment for Robot-in-the-Loop testing, built on the Virtual Environment for mobile Robotic Applications framework to enhance physics simulation and user interaction.

The setup combines Unity and ROS~2 to build a synchronized Digital Twin of the EMAROs mobile robot. This design allows the real robot to move on the floor of a laboratory while interacting with virtual, physics-based objects, which are sensed by virtual sensors. An Augmented Reality projection displays the simulation on the floor and a Virtual Reality interface allows for real-time interaction between humans and robots.

Validation through several scenarios, from human-robot interaction to autonomous missions with object manipulation, demonstrated the system's robustness. The framework maintained consistent low latency and stable frame rates even as the complexity of the virtual environment increased. These results demonstrate that the architecture provides a platform for testing autonomous robots by effectively connecting simulation and reality.
