  abstract = {The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is rapidly impacting the intelligent machines sector — on space missions, large agriculture equipment, multi-robot fleets, and more. Its success derives from its focused design and improved capabilities targeting product-grade and modern robotic systems. Following ROS 2’s example, the mobile robotics ecosystem has been fully redesigned based on the transformed needs of modern robots and is experiencing active development not seen since its inception. This paper comes from the desks of the key ROS Navigation maintainers to review and analyze the state of the art of robotics navigation in ROS 2. We discuss current research products and historically robust methods that provide differing behaviors and support for most robot types, and we provide expert insights organized by the fundamental problems in the field.}

  abstract       = {Digital twin (DT) technology has become a cornerstone in the simulation and analysis of real-world systems, offering unparalleled insights into the lifecycle management of physical assets. By providing a real-time synchronized replica of the physical entity, DTs enable predictive maintenance, performance optimization, and lifecycle extension, which are pivotal for industries aiming for digital transformation. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study of DT development of a robotic arm using two prominent simulation platforms: Unity and Gazebo. Unity, with its roots in the gaming industry, offers robust real-time rendering and a user-friendly interface, making it a versatile choice for various industries. Gazebo, traditionally used in robotics, provides detailed physics simulations and sensor data emulation, which is ideal for precise engineering applications. We explored the performance of both platforms in creating accurate and dynamic digital replicas. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, this study evaluates each platform’s strengths and limitations. The study assesses these platforms across key performance metrics such as accuracy, latency, graphic quality, and integration with the Robot Operating System (ROS). The DTs were developed using a consistent physical setup and communication layer to ensure fair comparisons. The results indicate that Unity performed better in terms of accurately mimicking the robotic arm with lower latency, making it ideal for applications requiring high-fidelity visualizations and real-time responsiveness. However, Gazebo excels in its ease of ROS integration and cost-effectiveness, making it a suitable choice for smaller robotics and automation projects. This study conducts an empirical comparison of these platforms in terms of their performance in creating DTs of robotic arms which is not readily available. This paper aims to guide developers and organizations in selecting the appropriate platform for their DT initiatives, ensuring efficient resource utilization and optimal outcomes.},

  abstract       = {Simulators play a critical role in the development and testing of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 applications. However, few studies have examined their capabilities beyond physics modeling, particularly in terms of connectivity and integration within broader robotic ecosystems. This review addresses this gap by focusing on ROS-compatible simulators. Using the SEGRESS methodology in combination with the PICOC framework, this study systematically analyzes 65 peer-reviewed articles published between 2021 and 2025 to identify key trends, capabilities, and application domains of ROS-integrated robotic simulators in industrial and manufacturing contexts. Our findings indicate that Gazebo is the most commonly used simulator in Industry 4.0, primarily due to its strong compatibility with ROS, while Unity is most prevalent in Industry 5.0 for its advanced visualization, support for human interaction, and extended reality (XR) features. Additionally, the study examines the adoption of ROS and ROS 2, and identifies complementary communication and integration technologies that help address the current interoperability challenges of ROS. These insights are intended to inform researchers and practitioners about the current landscape of simulation platforms and the core technologies frequently incorporated into robotics research.},

This review includes primary studies proposing Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) solutions where humans can control or interact with real robotic platforms using devices that extend the user’s reality. The objective of this article is not to present an extensive list of applications and tools. Instead, we present recent, relevant, common, and accessible frameworks and software tools implemented in research articles published in high-impact robotics conferences and journals. For this, we searched papers published during a seven-years period between 2015 and 2022 in relevant databases for robotics (Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, ACM digital library, Springer Link, and Web of Science). Additionally, we present and classify the application context of the reviewed articles in four groups: social robotics, programming of industrial robots, teleoperation of industrial robots, and Human–Robot collaboration (HRC).},
